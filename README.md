# A messy exploration of Nextflow

Nextflow is a fantastic tool for facilitating the construction and deployment of pipelines. This repository is meant to be home to a set of experiments to explore how we can create even more flexible/configurable workflows within the nextflow ecosystem.

Each directory is self-contained and is meant to explore different aspects of how we can perform more advanced configuration and pipeline construction within the nextflow/groovy ecosystem.
